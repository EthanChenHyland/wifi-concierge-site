**Bridging the Digital Divide, One Client at a Time...**

Wifi Concierge is a social entrepreneurship nonprofit initiative dedicated to bridging the digital divide among seniors and underserved communities. Our mission is to enhance clients' connections to the digital world, leading to better opportunities and an improved quality of life.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind Wifi Concierge stems from a family friend, Mr. Steve, who was using an outdated desktop computer with a wired internet connection and an expensive phone plan after his wife's untimely passing. We provided him with a modern laptop, an Android smartphone under an affordable plan, and a wireless router, granting him greater mobility and an improved internet experience.

## Our Services

We offer a range of services to improve digital connectivity:

- **Routers and Wireless Installation**: Providing clients with routers, streaming devices like Roku/Fire TV, and complimentary installation services to enhance wireless connectivity.

- **Digital Device Setup and Integration**: Incorporating smart home security systems, medical devices, printers, and other devices into the client's wireless network.

- **Personalized Technology Assistance**: Offering one-on-one troubleshooting for technology and wireless interfaces.

All services are provided free of charge; however, voluntary donations for satisfactory services are appreciated.
